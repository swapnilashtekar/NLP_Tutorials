Setting Up Your System

If you have not installed Python modules before, check out a tutorial such as this one, which gives instructions for installing modules from the Terminal (in Mac/Linux) or from the Command Prompt (in Windows).

Running this tutorial requires installation of the following packages. In most (or all) cases, we recommend that you use pip to install packages.

    pandas
    numpy
    scipy
    scikit-learn 
    Beautiful Soup
    NLTK
    Cython
    gensim

Word2Vec can be found in the gensim package. Note that we have only successfully run this tutorial on Mac OS X/Linux so far, not Windows.

The code in this tutorial was developed for Python 2.7.
